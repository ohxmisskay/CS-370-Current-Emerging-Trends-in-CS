# CS-370-Current-Emerging-Trends-in-CS

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

Project Two demonstrated basic concepts and techniques related to artificial intelligence and intelligent systems. In the project, we learned how to analyze how algorithms are used in artificial intelligence to solve various complex problems. Codes needed to be completed were to create epoch loops that would determine the random action for exploration. In results with neural networks, the trained agent could make informed decisions.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
1. What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

   A computer scientist uses expert technical knowledge to identify trends within business, industry, scientific, and social contexts. Computer scientstits are essential because they are improving the quality of life to making equal representation possible. For exmaple, computer scientists can address ethical concerns and also create tools to automate tasks that can optimize technnology today.

2. How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

   As a computer scientist, I approach the problem by being able to define the problem and identify critical values of the situation. Once I understand the scenario, I will gather all possible data relevant to the situation. I would recognize any constraints or limitations hindering my investigation during this time. The next phase is to design and test a solution by developing an algorithm with the appropriate data structures using the tools and techniques provided by prior experiences.

3. What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

   Ethical responsibilities to the end users and the organization are to protect privacy or user data and follow industry standards with regulations and moral codes. Examples include minimizing data collection to only refer to what is essential regarding the project. Another responsibility is to be honest and transparent in all the work completed. Clear communication and acknowledging the limitations can help be transparent about risks and shortcomings and avoid unsafe practices.
